<p>
Assignments within sub-expressions are hard to spot and therefore make the code less readable.
It is also a common mistake to write <code>=</code> when <code>==</code> was meant.
Ideally, every expression should have no more than one side-effect.
Assignments inside lambda and delegate expressions are allowed.

<p>The following code:</p>

<pre>
foo(i = 42);  // Non-Compliant
</pre>

<p>should be refactored into:</p>

<pre>
i = 42;
foo(i);       // Compliant
</pre>

or:

<pre>
foo(i == 42); // Compliant
</pre>
