Sharing some naming conventions is a key point to make it possible for a team to efficiently collaborate.
This rule allows to check that all class names match a provided regular expression.

<p>The following code:</p>

<pre>
void foo() // Non-Compliant
{
}
</pre>

<p>should be refactored into:</p>

<pre>
void Foo() // Compliant
{
}
</pre>
